# Detailed Analysis of the statement
Let's start with the status quo...........
There is a librarian in my school.
I approached him and asked, "Hello, I was wondering- How do you keep track of the books we borrow from you? You don't mantain any record books or any equivalent thing."
He said, "Are you living in 1950 or so? ".
         "I keep the records in my excel worksheet. The computers are most effective record keeping devices."
I replied, "Oh! My God, You need to type every record on your own!".
He said, "Yes, that is my work and i have also learned typing, so it is easy for me.".
I questioned, "What if your files were accessed by a student and he manipulates the records ? Do you have a backup or authentication?".
He said,"As i am also a teacher here, no student has got guts to do anything with my computer. And I regularly mantain a handwritten records of the data.".
I said, "But it is still a daunting task.".
He replied, "Yes, but thats my responsibility.",
Then i said,"There are a number of softwares available and you can buy them for your work.".
He answered,"Yes, there are but those are not free to use, I or school authority have to pay for them ","Many times I have asked your principal for this, 
but the authority is unable to bear the expenses ".
For the whole day, "I taught about this problem.". 
Then a solution sprang in my mind, "I CAN MAKE THIS SOFTWARE, IT WILL BE A FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE TO BUILD A SYSTEM ADHERING TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LIBRARIAN".

So, I regularly met with the librarian and asked him about his requirements.
These were his requirements :-
1. An Authentication System to uniquely identify me.
2. A easy to use interface.
3. A way to see the list of books directly on the screen.
4. A way to see the list of borrowed and booked books directly.
5. An easy and quick process to enter the details while the book is being borrowed.
6. A future proof system, if i want to add some magzines and books to the available pool this should be easy.
7. The details of the books must follow a structure as (NAME, AUTHOR_NAME,PUBLISHER_NAME,PUBLISHED_YEAR,BOOK_ID,NUMBER_OF_COPIES)

These were the 7 requirements from the software.
