# Technical Stack 
So, the goal is to create a window application that can perform all the tasks. The application must be divided into two parts and 
i can keep track of the components that work for one part.
## 1. Front End 
For the **basic UI** of the application I decided to use the state of the art technique to build UI in fastest possible way. 
It was using the **Java's SWING API**.
This programming interface has ready to use tools. 

It is **effective** for the scope of the project.

## 2. Back End 
For backend I had two options as i was looking for a relational database system, so these were most famous ones..  
1. **MySQL**
2. **MongoDB**

**MySQL**
This was RDBMS which was taught in my high school as per the curriculum. This Database Management System is composed of a easy to use **Command Line Interface** and a good Visulization tools in **MySQL Workbench**.

**Command Line Interface of SQL**
